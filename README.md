## Unresolved Questions

Question 1: Can the XRTK - Mixed Reality Toolkit work on NReal Lite?
The XRTK is the Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity. https://xrtk.io/README.html

https://github.com/XRTK/XRTK-Core

https://github.com/XRTK/Nreal

Created an issue here to ask about this repository and they said it does not likely support Nreal yet https://github.com/XRTK/Nreal/issues/15

Question 2: 

## Open Source Projects Wanted

Would like to see a few demos progressively building up features.

1. A 3D cube always in front of the user on the screen.
2. A 3D cube which stays "in place" while the user can walk around it.
3. A screen display of what the front facing RGB camera sees.
4. Playing stereo music through the audio.
5. Recording audio through the duel microphones.
6. Picking up data from the sensors such as IMU (Accelerometer, Gyroscope), other sensors listed here https://www.nreal.ai/light/
7. WebXR running on NReal, well it says here "Last, but not least, Nreal says itâ€™s adding WebXR support to the Light platform, enabling web applications to properly display content through the stereoscopic 3D glasses" https://uploadvr.com/nreal-ar-multi-user-webxr/
